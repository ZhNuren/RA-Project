This is the paper we have been writing while working as Research Assistant of Professor Jurn Gyu Park. It is based on finding bottleneck in the 
Single Precisioin General Matrix Multiplication (SGEMM) algorithms. We have been working with NVIDIA Visual Profiler to evaluate the algorithms we have wrote. 
Our custom SGEMM algorithm could achieve about 80% of performance of CUBLAS SGEMM algorithm.
